Added functionalities as per the task:-

1. Register, Login and logout, forget password
2. Manage employees (Add, edit, update and delete).
3. Search and sort (with multiple fields).
4. Pagination
5. Validation
 
 I have developed few functionalities according to the task, you will need to run few commands which I have mentioned below:-

    php artisan migrate
    php artisan db:seed --class=DepartmentsTableSeeder
    npm install
    npm run build
    npm run dev
    php artisan serve

Use these commands and use the URL http://127.0.0.1:8000 to the browser.

I have used the npm packages to auto load the page.

Also Made seeder to add few departments in the table so I can easily use them while creating employees.

Please go through with the test and let me now the results.

Thank You
